# Algorithms Concepts

QuickGraph contains a set of algorithms that solve classic graph theory problems. Algorithms are designed around the [command pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern), i.e. their execution is encapsulated into classes. Most algorithms are categorized by the kind of problem they can solve (note that some algorithms just donâ€™t fit in those categories):

* Vertex predecessors,
* Edge predecessors,
* Vertex distances,
* Time stampers

_tip:_ The ```QuickGraph.Algorithms``` namespace contains a static class, [AlgorithmExtensions](AlgorithmExtensions), that contains a set of extension methods that encapsulate the creation and processing of algorithms instances.
