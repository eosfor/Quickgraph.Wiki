### Algorithm Extensions

`AlgorithmExtensions` (in the `QuickGraph.Algorithms` namespace) provides a number of **extension methods** on graphs to solve common graph problems.

#### Enabling the extensions

* Set your project to use .Net 3.5 or above,
* Add a reference to the `QuickGraph.Algorithms` namespace,
```
using QuickGraph.Algorithms;
```
The extension methods will be enabled for the graph instances.
