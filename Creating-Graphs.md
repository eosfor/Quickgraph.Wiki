# Creating Graphs

## Easy creation with extension methods

QuickGraph provides several extension methods in ```QuickGraph.GraphExtensions``` to create graph from list of edge or vertices. For example, from an ``IEnumerable<Edge<int>>```:

```csharp
using QuickGraph; // enables extension methods

var edges = new SEdge<int>[]() { new SEdge<int>(1,2), new SEdge<int>(0,1) };
var graph = edges.ToAdjacencyGraph<int, SEdge<int>>(edges);
```

## Create a graph instance

Let us assume we need integer vertices and edges tagged with string. Int is the vertex type and we can use the TaggedEdge generic type for the edge type:

* ```TVertex``` type: ```int```
* ```TEdge``` type using ```TaggedEdge<Vertex,Marker>: TaggedEdge<int, string>```

```csharp
var g = new AdjacencyGraph<int, TaggedEdge<int, string>>();
```

## Wrapping a dictionary into a graph

You may have already a dictionary on hand that represents a graph, where the keys are the vertices and the value is a collection of out-edges (or adjacent edges). You can wrap this dictionary with QuickGraph without re-allocating new memory:

```csharp
Dictionary<int, int[]()> dic = ...; // vertex -> target edges
var graph = dic.ToVertexAndEdgeListGraph(
    kv => Array.ConvertAll(kv.Value, v => new SEquatableEdge<int>(kv.Key, v))
    );

// without extension methods
var graph = GraphExtensions.ToVertexAndEdgeListGraph(
    dic,
    kv => Array.ConvertAll(kv.Value, v => new SEquatableEdge<int>(kv.Key, v))
    );
```

## Adding vertices

This snippet creates two vertices and adds them to the graph.

```csharp
int v1 = 1;
int v2 = 2;

g.AddVertex(v1);
g.AddVertex(v2);
```

## Adding edges

The edges ```(v1,v2)``` and ```(v2,v1)``` are created and added to the graph.

```csharp
var e1 = new TaggedEdge<int,string>(v1,v2,”hello”);

g.AddEdge(e1); 
```

## Adding edges (and vertices)

You can also add an edge and implicitly add the vertices if they are missing

```csharp
// v3, v4 are not added to the graph yet
var e2 = new TaggedEdge<int,string>(v3,v4,”hello”);

g.AddVerticesAndEdge(e2);
```
