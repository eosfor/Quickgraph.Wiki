### Developer Manual

#### Branches

* Requires Visual Studio 2010
* 2.0: deprecated.
* 3.0:
	* .NET 2.0:
		* Use the `Release20` configuration.
	* .NET 3.5:
		* Use the `Debug`, `Release` configurations.
	* .NET 3.5 + Code Contracts:
		* Use the `DebugContracts` configuration.

As you may notice, the same codebase is used for .net 2.0 and .net 3.5. This means that anything that belongs to `System.Core` must be duplicated in QuickGraph conditionally. In that sense,
	* do not use Linq. If you do, add the required method in the `Enumerable` type.
	* put the `this` of extenion methods in an `#ifdef` region.
```
#if !NET20
    this
#endif
```

#### External tools

* Code Contracts [http://research.microsoft.com/contracts](http://research.microsoft.com/contracts) (optional)
* Pex [http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/downloads.aspx](http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/downloads.aspx) (required)

#### Getting the source code

* Using the svn bridge is the recommended method to sync the sources.
