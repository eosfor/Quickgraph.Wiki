# Edges

While a vertex could be any type with QuickGraph, the edge type must implement ```IEdge<TVertex>``` (and comply to it's contract). QuickGraph comes with various default implementations:

* classes
  * ```Edge<TVertex>```, an vanilla implementation,
  * ```EquatableEdge<TVertex>```, implements ```IEquatable<EquatableEdge<TVertex>>```,
  * ```TaggedEdge<TVertex,TTag>```, holds a tag,
  * ```TaggedEquatableEdge<TVertex,TTag>```, equatable and holds a tag,
* structs
  * ```SEdge<TVertex>```, an immutable edge,
  * ```SEquatableEdge<TVertex>```, a struct that implements ```IEquatable<SEquatableEdge<TVertex>>```,
  * ```STaggedEdge<TVertex, TTag>```, holds a tag
  * ```STaggedEquatableEdge<TVertex,TTag>```, equatable and holds a tag,

The ```struct``` based edge will provide better performance and should be used when you do not plan to use custom edges. Of course, you can always implement your own version ```IEdge<TVertex>```. Tagged edges also implement ```ITagged<TTag>```.

## Undirected edges

In undirected graphs, the order of the source or target vertices should not matter. In order to improve efficiency, edges that implement the ```IUndirectedEdge<TVertex>``` interface must sort the vertices so that ```Source <= Target``` (with respect to the default Comparer). This provides some performance gains in various data structures and algorithms.

* classes
  * ```UndirectedEdge<TVertex>```, an vanilla implementation,
  * ```TaggedUndirectedEdge<TVertex,TTag>```, holds a tag,
* structs
  * ```SUndirectedEdge<TVertex>```, an immutable edge,
  * ```SUndirectedTaggedEdge<TVertex, TTag>```, holds a tag
