#### Mutation concepts

The **mutation concepts** define the different ways a graph can be modified. The hierarchy of mutation interface duplicates the traversal hierarchy and adds functionality to mutate the graph.

* `IMutableGraph` defines a graph that can be cleared,
* `IMutableIncidenceGraph` defines methods to remove out-edges,
* `IMutableVertexListGraph` defines methods to add and remove vertices,
* `IMutableEdgeListGraph` defines methods to add and remove edges
* `IMutableVertexAndEdgeListGraph` merges the two above concepts,
* `IMutableBidirectionalGraph` defines method to remove out-edges
