# Overview

**QuickGraph 2.0** is a library containing generic graph data structures and algorithms for .Net

* _Generic_: QuickGraph uses .Net 2.0 generics which makes it very flexible and more efficient,
* [Graph data structures](Graph-data-structures): [adjacency list](adjacency-list) and [bidirectional list](bidirectional-list) to represent directed graph,
* [Algorithms](Algorithms.md): efficient algorithms for solving classic graph theory problems like [maximum flow](maximum-flow.md), [topological sort](topological-sort.md), [shortest path](shortest-path.md), [depth first search](depth-first-search.md), etc.

Classic graph examples are:

* Transportation network:
  * vertex = crossing,
  * edge = road,
* Internet:
  * vertex = computer,
  * edge = telephone line,
* Source code files:
  * vertex = file,
  * edge = dependency
