# Visualization Using Graphviz

QuickGraph supports generating _dot files_, the file format of [Graphviz](Graphviz). All Graphviz related code are located in the `QuickGraph.Graphviz.dll` assembly.

## Basic graph rendering

The `GraphvizAlgorithm` class contains the logic to render a `IVertexAndEdgeListGraph`.

* `GraphFormat`, `CommonVertexFormat` and `CommonEdgeFormat` control the default 'looks' of the generated graph,
* `FormatVertex` and `FormatEdge` events let you customize the display of individual vertices and edges.

```csharp
IVertexAndEdgeListGraph<TVertex,TEdge> g= ...;
var graphviz = new GraphvizAlgorithm<TVertex,TEdge>(g);

// render
string output = graphviz.Generate(new FileDotEngine(), "graph");
```

## Custom Rendering of Dot

QuickGraph sends the generated `dot` code to a 'dot engine' interface which is supposed to do the rest of the work. This is where you can plugin and add any additional steps. QuickGraph provides a simple rendering engine that writes the dot file to disk :)

```csharp
public interface IDotEngine
{
    // renders the dot code and returns the name of the generated file
    string Run(
        GraphvizImageType imageType,
        string dot,
        string outputFileName);
}
```
