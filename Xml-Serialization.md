# Xml Serialization

QuickGraph supports loading and saving graphs to and from Xml. The implementation builds on top of `XmlReader` and `XmlWriter` and is located in the `SerializationExtensions` class from the `QuickGraph.Serialization` namespace.

## Serializing graphs

To serialize a graph, call the `SerializeToXml` extension methods with an `XmlWriter` instance and delegates that can map vertices and edges to an identifier string. The serialization method also supports custom delegate to write additional information per vertex, edge

```csharp
class MyVertex {
    public int ID { get;set; }
}
class MyEdge : IEdge<MyVertex> {
    string Name { get; set; }
    string Tag { get; set; }
}
var g = new AdjacencyGraph<MyVexte, MyEdge>();
...
using(var xwriter = XmlWriter.Create(...))
    g.SerializeToXml(
        xwriter,
        v => v.ID, // let's use ID as the vertex ID
        AlgorithmExtensions.GetEdgeIdentity(graph), // let QuickGraph give an id to edges
        "graph", "myvertex", "myedge", "" // names of the graph, vertex, node xml tags and the namespace uri
        );
```

## Deserializing graphs

To deserialize a graph, create the graph instance and call the `DeserializeFromXml`.

## Serializing Custom Fields

The serializer supports the delegates to write additional information of the vertex, edge and graph types.
